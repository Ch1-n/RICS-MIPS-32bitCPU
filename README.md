# RICS-MIPS-32bitCPU
1) A five-stage integer pipeline is used to implement logical operations, shift operations, move operations, arithmetic operations, transfer operations, load-store operations, coprocessor access, etc.; 
2) 2) Solve data-related problems; 
3) 3) Five-stage integer pipelines, They are: fetch, decode, execute, fetch, write back; 
4) 4) Harvard structure, separate instruction and data interface; 32 32-bit integer registers; big endian;
5)  5) 32-bit data and address bus width; Can realize single-cycle multiplication; 
6)  6) Compatible with MIPS32 instruction set architecture, supporting all integer instructions in MIPS32 instruction set; 
7)  7) Most instructions can be completed in one clock cycle;
